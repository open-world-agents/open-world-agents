# Introducing OWAMcap

## Overview

OWAMcap is a high-performance, self-contained, flexible container file format for multimodal desktop log data, powered by the open-source container file format [mcap](https://mcap.dev/). This format is designed for efficiently recording and processing message data in Open World Agents (OWA) applications with **ZSTD compression** achieving 80%+ file size reduction.

!!! tip "So, what exactly is mcap?"
Simply put, mcap is a format that allows you to record various types of events such as keyboard events, mouse events, and screen captures along with their timestamps. For more detailed information, please refer to the [OWAMcap Format Specification](#internals-owamcap-format-specification) section.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights

- **ZSTD Compression**: Achieves 80%+ file size reduction while maintaining fast read/write performance
- **Self-Contained Format**: All metadata and schemas embedded within the file
- **High-Frequency Data Support**: Handles 60+ FPS screen capture with synchronized events
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Standard mcap format ensures broad tool ecosystem support

## Usage Example of OWAMcap - Desktop Recorder

### Exploring Example Data

Let's examine the contents of an OWAMcap file using the `ocap` command-line tool (Open World agents Desktop Recorder).

#### File Summary with `owl mcap info`

First, we can get an overview of the file structure:

```
$ owl mcap info example.mcap
library:   mcap-owa-support 0.1.0; mcap 1.2.2
profile:   owa
messages:  518
duration:  6.8558623s
start:     2025-03-21T17:06:30.7029335+09:00 (1742544390.702933500)
end:       2025-03-21T17:06:37.5587958+09:00 (1742544397.558795800)
compression:
        zstd: [1/1 chunks] [48.19 KiB/9.42 KiB (80.44%)] [1.37 KiB/sec]
channels:
        (1) window            7 msgs (1.02 Hz)    : owa.env.desktop.msg.WindowInfo [jsonschema]
        (2) keyboard/state    7 msgs (1.02 Hz)    : owa.env.desktop.msg.KeyboardState [jsonschema]
        (3) mouse/state       7 msgs (1.02 Hz)    : owa.env.desktop.msg.MouseState [jsonschema]
        (4) mouse           115 msgs (16.77 Hz)   : owa.env.desktop.msg.MouseEvent [jsonschema]
        (5) screen          362 msgs (52.80 Hz)   : owa.env.gst.msg.ScreenEmitted [jsonschema]
        (6) keyboard         20 msgs (2.92 Hz)    : owa.env.desktop.msg.KeyboardEvent [jsonschema]
channels: 6
attachments: 0
metadata: 0
```

**Key observations from this output:**

1. **File Overview**:

   - Contains 518 messages recorded over 6.86 seconds
   - Records from March 21, 2025, with precise start and end timestamps

2. **Compression Performance**:

   - Uses **ZSTD compression**, reducing file size by **80.44%** (from 48.19 KiB to 9.42 KiB)
   - Maintains high compression speed at 1.37 KiB/sec

3. **Channels (Topics)**:

   - The file contains 6 different channels (or topics), each tracking a specific type of event:

   | Channel # | Name           | Message Count | Frequency | Message Type  | Description                    |
   | --------- | -------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
   | 1         | window         | 7 msgs        | 1.02 Hz   | WindowInfo    | Active window tracking         |
   | 2         | keyboard/state | 7 msgs        | 1.02 Hz   | KeyboardState | Keyboard state snapshots       |
   | 3         | mouse/state    | 7 msgs        | 1.02 Hz   | MouseState    | Mouse position & button states |
   | 4         | mouse          | 115 msgs      | 16.77 Hz  | MouseEvent    | Real-time mouse events         |
   | 5         | screen         | 362 msgs      | 52.80 Hz  | ScreenEmitted | High-frequency screen capture  |
   | 6         | keyboard       | 20 msgs       | 2.92 Hz   | KeyboardEvent | Keyboard press/release events  |

For example, looking at channel #5 (screen), we can see:

- The topic name is "screen"
- It contains 362 messages
- Recording frequency is **52.80 Hz** (slightly lower than the intended 60 Hz, likely due to the short recording time)
- Messages are of type `owa.env.gst.msg.ScreenEmitted`
- **Each message links to H.265-encoded frames** in the companion MKV file

#### Detailed Message Inspection with `ocap cat`

To examine individual messages, we can use the `cat` command:

```
$ ocap cat example.mcap --n 8 --no-pretty
Topic: window, Timestamp: 1741628814049712700, Message: {'title': 'ZType â€“ Typing Game - Type to Shoot - Chromium', 'rect': [389, 10, 955, 1022], 'hWnd': 7540094}
Topic: keyboard/state, Timestamp: 1741628814049712700, Message: {'buttons': []}
Topic: mouse/state, Timestamp: 1742544390703436600, Message: {'x': 1594, 'y': 1112, 'buttons': []}
Topic: mouse, Timestamp: 1742544390707441200, Message: {'event_type': 'move', 'x': 1597, 'y': 1112}
Topic: screen, Timestamp: 1741628814057575300, Message: {'path': 'example.mkv', 'pts': 14866666666, 'utc_ns': 1741628814056571100}
Topic: screen, Timestamp: 1741628814073392700, Message: {'path': 'example.mkv', 'pts': 14883333333, 'utc_ns': 1741628814072476900}
Topic: keyboard, Timestamp: 1741628815015522100, Message: {'event_type': 'release', 'vk': 162}
```

**What we can learn from these messages:**

1. **Window messages** - Track active windows with pixel-perfect positioning

   - Example: `{'title': 'ZType â€“ Typing Game - Type to Shoot - Chromium', 'rect': [389, 10, 955, 1022], 'hWnd': 7540094}`
   - Shows which window was active, its title, position and size

2. **Mouse messages** - High-precision cursor tracking

   - Position tracking: `{'x': 1597, 'y': 1112}` with pixel-level accuracy
   - Event types include: "move", "click", "scroll" etc.

3. **Keyboard messages** - Complete keystroke capture

   - Example: `{'event_type': 'release', 'vk': 162}` (Virtual Key Code 162 = Left Ctrl)
   - Records both press and release events with precise timing

4. **Screen messages** - Direct links to H.265-encoded video frames
   - Contains paths to MKV files, presentation timestamps (PTS), and UTC timestamps
   - **Each frame is H.265-encoded** for optimal storage efficiency
   - Supports frame-perfect synchronization with input events

#### Using This Data

This structured data allows for powerful analysis and use cases:

- You can filter data based on which window was active at a particular time
- You can synchronize keyboard/mouse events with screen captures
- The timestamps allow for precise reconstruction of user interactions

!!! tip "What's VK(Virtual Key Code)?"
Operating systems don't directly use the physical keyboard input values (scan codes) but instead use virtualized keys called VKs. OWA's recorder uses VKs to record keyboard-agnostic data. If you're interested in more details, you can refer to the following resources:

    - [Keyboard Input Overview, Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/about-keyboard-input)
    - [Virtual-Key Codes, Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes)

## Internals - OWAMcap Format Specification

!!! note "Note for Users"
This part is intended for developers who want to utilize the OWAMcap file format for their own applications. **Regular users of the library may not need this information.**

### Technical Specifications

- OWAMcap uses the standard `mcap` format with `json` schema
- The [`mcap-owa-support`](https://github.com/open-world-agents/open-world-agents/tree/main/projects/mcap-owa-support) Python package, which is within the open-world-agents repository, provides decoders, writers, and readers for this format
- All messages must inherit from or implement the [`BaseMessage`](https://github.com/open-world-agents/open-world-agents/blob/main/projects/owa-core/owa/core/message.py#L7) class from `owa.core.message`

!!! mcap "What's MCAP?"
MCAP (pronounced "em-cap") is an open-source container file format designed for multimodal log data. It supports multiple channels of timestamped pre-serialized data and is ideal for pub/sub or robotics applications.

    Key advantages of MCAP:

    - **High Performance**: Efficient storage and retrieval of large event data streams
    - **Flexible & Open**: Works with diverse data types beyond robotics
    - **Self-Describing**: Encodes schema information to ensure compatibility

### Implementation Guide

Any message that implements [`BaseMessage`](https://github.com/open-world-agents/open-world-agents/blob/main/projects/owa-core/owa/core/message.py#L7) can be recorded in the OWAMcap format. This provides flexibility while maintaining a consistent interface. Following block describes the interface of `BaseMessage`.

```python
class BaseMessage(ABC):
    _type: str

    @abstractmethod
    def serialize(self, buffer: io.BytesIO): ...

    @classmethod
    @abstractmethod
    def deserialize(cls, buffer: io.BytesIO) -> Self: ...

    @classmethod
    @abstractmethod
    def get_schema(cls): ...
```

### File Format Considerations

#### Why Use `.mcap`?

There are very few open-source formats available for heterogeneous timestamped data. ROS's bagfile format is one option, but it heavily depends on the ROS ecosystem and often requires installation of ROS1/2. In comparison, `mcap` is self-contained and efficient, especially for random read (or seeking) operations, which is critical for training VLA (Vision-Language-Action) models.
